Dear Internee.pk Team,

My name is Muhammad Yahya Rais, and I am currently pursuing my Intermediate in Computer Science (FSc) from Karachi. I prefer to be called Yahya.

I have a great interest in technology, especially in Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Mobile Applications. I love to build creative things using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Outside the tech world, I enjoy playing cricket, watching tech-related movies, and learning new things every day.

I would like to thank Internee.pk for providing this virtual internship opportunity. I am excited to be a part of this program and hope to gain practical experience, improve my technical skills, and work on real-world projects.

Thank you once again!

Best regards,  
Muhammad Yahya Rais
